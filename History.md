==================

  * Major refactor of how data is stored, which fixes a number of bugs which were creating duplicate entries
    - _id field is now generated by cache to guarantee no dup entries, instead of using objectID.  See the docs for details.
  * Moved to official MongoDB URI format for connections, allows slaveok parameter
  * Fixed more outstanding issues; bad code was making lookups fail.
  * Added support for Sparse collections, in which each key is a row.     
    -  For Beaker Sessions, this already happens automatically, but in say Pylons Caching of a specific template, it puts it all in one place.  u
    -  This forces it to split, and should help performance.
